	abstract = {We propose to identify compromised mobile devices from a network administrator’s point of view. Intuitively, inadvertent users (and thus their devices) who download apps through untrustworthy markets are often lured to install malicious apps through in-app advertisements or phishing. We thus hypothesize that devices sharing similar apps would have a similar likelihood of being compromised, resulting in an association between a compromised device and its apps. We propose to leverage such associations to identify unknown compromised devices using the guilt-by-association principle. Admittedly, such associations could be relatively weak as it is hard, if not impossible, for an app to automatically download and install other apps without explicit user initiation. We describe how we can magnify such associations by carefully choosing parameters when applying graph-based inferences. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on real datasets provided by a major mobile service provider. Specifically, we show that our approach achieves nearly 98\%
              AUC (area under the ROC curve)
              and further detects as many as 6 {\textasciitilde} 7 times of new compromised devices not covered by the ground truth by expanding the limited knowledge on known devices. We show that the newly detected devices indeed present undesirable behavior in terms of leaking private information and accessing risky IPs and domains. We further conduct in-depth analysis of the effectiveness of graph inferences to understand the unique structure of the associations between mobile devices and their apps, and its impact on graph inferences, based on which we propose how to choose key parameters.},

	abstract = {Malicious domains, including phishing websites, spam servers, and command and control servers, are the reason for many of the cyber attacks nowadays. Thus, detecting them in a timely manner is important to not only identify cyber attacks but also take preventive measures. There has been a plethora of techniques proposed to detect malicious domains by analyzing Domain Name System (DNS) traffic data. Traditionally, DNS acts as an Internet miscreant’s best friend, but we observe that the subtle traces in DNS logs left by such miscreants can be used against them to detect malicious domains. Our approach is to build a set of domain graphs by connecting “related” domains together and injecting known malicious and benign domains into these graphs so that we can make inferences about the other domains in the domain graphs. A key challenge in building these graphs is how to accurately identify related domains so that incorrect associations are minimized and the number of domains connected from the dataset is maximized. Based on our observations, we first train two classifiers and then devise a set of association rules that assist in linking domains together. We perform an in-depth empirical analysis of the graphs built using these association rules on passive DNS data and show that our techniques can detect many more malicious domains than the state-of-the-art.},

	abstract = {Malicious domains are one of the major resources required for adversaries to run attacks over the Internet. Due to the important role of the Domain Name System (DNS), extensive research has been conducted to identify malicious domains based on their unique behavior reflected in different phases of the life cycle of DNS queries and responses. Existing approaches differ significantly in terms of intuitions, data analysis methods as well as evaluation methodologies. This warrants a thorough systematization of the approaches and a careful review of the advantages and limitations of every group.
            In this article, we perform such an analysis. To achieve this goal, we present the necessary background knowledge on DNS and malicious activities leveraging DNS. We describe a general framework of malicious domain detection techniques using DNS data. Applying this framework, we categorize existing approaches using several orthogonal viewpoints, namely (1) sources of DNS data and their enrichment, (2) data analysis methods, and (3) evaluation strategies and metrics. In each aspect, we discuss the important challenges that the research community should address in order to fully realize the power of DNS data analysis to fight against attacks leveraging malicious domains.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new method for camera-model identification. Our approach combines two independent aspects of video file generation corresponding to video coding and media data encapsulation. To this end, a joint representation of the overall file metadata is developed and used in conjunction with a two-level hierarchical classification method. At the first level, our method groups videos into metaclasses considering several abstractions that represent high-level structural properties of file metadata. This is followed by a more nuanced classification of classes that comprise each metaclass. The method is evaluated on more than 20K videos obtained by combining four public video datasets. Tests show that a balanced accuracy of 91\% is achieved in correctly identifying the class of a video among 119 video classes. This corresponds to an improvement of 6.5\% over the conventional approach based on video file encapsulation characteristics. Furthermore, we investigate a setting relevant to forensic file recovery operations where file metadata cannot be located or are missing but video data is partially available. By estimating a partial list of encoding parameters from coded video data, we demonstrate that an identification accuracy of 57\% can be achieved in camera-model identification in the absence of any other file metadata.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new method for camera-model identification. Our approach combines two independent aspects of video file generation corresponding to video coding and media data encapsulation. To this end, a joint representation of the overall file metadata is developed and used in conjunction with a two-level hierarchical classification method. At the first level, our method groups videos into metaclasses considering several abstractions that represent high-level structural properties of file metadata. This is followed by a more nuanced classification of classes that comprise each metaclass. The method is evaluated on more than 20K videos obtained by combining four public video datasets. Tests show that a balanced accuracy of 91\% is achieved in correctly identifying the class of a video among 119 video classes. This corresponds to an improvement of 6.5\% over the conventional approach based on video file encapsulation characteristics. Furthermore, we investigate a setting relevant to forensic file recovery operations where file metadata cannot be located or are missing but video data is partially available. By estimating a partial list of encoding parameters from coded video data, we demonstrate that an identification accuracy of 57\% can be achieved in camera-model identification in the absence of any other file metadata.},

	abstract = {Machine learning models, especially neural network (NN) classifiers, are widely used in many applications including natural language processing, computer vision and cybersecurity. They provide high accuracy under the assumption of attack-free scenarios. However, this assumption has been defied by the introduction of adversarial examples – carefully perturbed samples of input that are usually misclassified. Many researchers have tried to develop a defense against adversarial examples; however, we are still far from achieving that goal. In this paper, we design a Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) based adversarial training defense, dubbed GanDef, which utilizes a competition game to regulate the feature selection during the training. We analytically show that GanDef can train a classifier so it can defend against adversarial examples. Through extensive evaluation on different white-box adversarial examples, the classifier trained by GanDef shows the same level of test accuracy as those trained by state-of-the-art adversarial training defenses. More importantly, GanDef-Comb, a variant of GanDef, could utilize the discriminator to achieve a dynamic trade-off between correctly classifying original and adversarial examples. As a result, it achieves the highest overall test accuracy when the ratio of adversarial examples exceeds 41.7\%.},
