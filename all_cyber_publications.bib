	abstract     = {With the rapid increase of threats on the Internet, people are continuously seeking privacy and anonymity. Services such as Bitcoin and Tor were introduced to provide anonymity for online transactions and Web browsing. Due to its pseudonymity model, Bitcoin lacks retroactive operational security, which means historical pieces of information could be used to identify a certain user. By exploiting publicly available information, we show how relying on Bitcoin for payments on Tor hidden services could lead to deanonymization of these services’ users. Such linking is possible by finding at least one past transaction in the Blockchain that involves their publicly declared Bitcoin addresses. To demonstrate the consequences of this deanonymization approach, we carried out a real-world experiment simulating a passive, limited adversary. We crawled 1.5K hidden services and collected 88 unique and active Bitcoin addresses. We then crawled 5B tweets and 1M BitcoinTalk forum pages and collected 4.2K and 41K unique Bitcoin addresses, respectively. Each user address was associated with an online identity along with its public profile information. By analyzing the transactions in the Blockchain, we were able to link 125 unique users to 20 hidden services, including sensitive ones, such as The Pirate Bay and Silk Road. We also analyzed two case studies in detail to demonstrate the implications of the information leakage on users anonymity. In particular, we confirm that Bitcoin addresses should be considered exploitable, as they can be used to deanonymize users retroactively. This is especially important for Tor hidden service users who actively seek and expect privacy and anonymity.}

	abstract     = {Tor~citetor is the most widely used anonymous communication network with millions of daily users~citetormetrics. Since Tor provides server and client anonymity, hundreds of malware binaries found in the wild rely on it to hide their presence and hinder Command \& Control (C&C) takedown operations. We believe Tor is a paramount tool enabling online freedom and privacy, and blocking it to defend against such malware is infeasible for both users and organizations. In this work, we present effective traffic analysis approaches that can accurately identify Tor-based malware communication. We collect hundreds of Tor-based malware binaries, execute and examine more than 47,000 active encrypted malware connections and compare them with benign browsing traffic. In addition to traditional traffic analysis features (which work at the connection level), we propose global host-level network features to capture peculiar malware communication fingerprints across host logs. Our experiments confirm that our models are able to detect "zero-day'' malware connections with 0.7\% FPR even when malware connections constitute less than 5\% of Tor traces in the test set. Using multi-labeling approaches, we are able to accurately detect the malware behavior-based classes (grayware, ransomware, etc). Finally, we evaluate the robustness of our models on real-world enterprise logs and show that the classifiers can identify infected hosts even with missing features.},

We observe through our deep dive analysis that artifacts of phishing are manifested in various sources of intelligence related to a domain even before its contents are online. In particular, we study various novel patterns and characteristics computed from viable sources of data including Certificate Transparency Logs, and passive DNS records. To compare benign and phishing domains, we construct thoroughly-verified realistic benign and phishing datasets. Our analysis shows clear differences between benign and phishing domains that can pave the way for content-agnostic approaches to predict phishing domains even before the contents of these webpages are up and running. To demonstrate the usefulness of our analysis, we train a classifier with distinctive features, and we show that we can (1) perform content-agnostic predictions with a very low FPR of 0.3\%, and high precision (98\%) and recall (90\%), and (2) predict phishing domains days before they are discovered by state-of-the-art content-based tools such as VirusTotal.},
