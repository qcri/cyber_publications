abstract = {This paper introduces SGCode, a flexible prompt-optimizing system to generate secure code with large language models (LLMs). SGCode integrates recent prompt-optimization approaches with LLMs in a unified system accessible through front-end and back-end APIs, enabling users to 1) generate secure code, which is free of vulnerabilities, 2) review and share security analysis, and 3) easily switch from one prompt optimization approach to another, while providing insights on model and system performance. We populated SGCode on an AWS server with PromSec, an approach that optimizes prompts by combining an LLM and security tools with a lightweight generative adversarial graph neural network to detect and fix security vulnerabilities in the generated code. Extensive experiments show that SGCode is practical as a public tool to gain insights into the trade-offs between model utility, secure code generation, and system cost. SGCode has only a marginal cost compared with prompting LLMs. SGCode is available at: http://3.131.141.63:8501/.},

abstract = {The capability of generating high-quality source code using large language models (LLMs) reduces software development time and costs. However, recent literature and our empirical investigation in this work show that while LLMs can generate functioning code, they inherently tend to introduce security vulnerabilities, limiting their potential. This problem is mainly due to their training on massive open-source corpora exhibiting insecure and inefficient programming practices. Therefore, automatic optimization of LLM prompts for generating secure and functioning code is a demanding need. This paper introduces PromSec, an algorithm for <u>prom</u>pt optimization for <u>sec</u>ure and functioning code generation using LLMs. In PromSec, we combine 1) code vulnerability clearing using a generative adversarial graph neural network, dubbed as gGAN, to fix and reduce security vulnerabilities in generated codes and 2) code generation using an LLM into an interactive loop, such that the outcome of the gGAN drives the LLM with enhanced prompts to generate secure codes while preserving their functionality. Introducing a new contrastive learning approach in gGAN, we formulate the code-clearing and generation loop as a dual-objective optimization problem, enabling PromSec to notably reduce the number of LLM inferences. As a result, PromSec becomes a cost-effective and practical solution for generating secure and functioning codes.Extensive experiments conducted on Python and Java code datasets confirm that PromSec effectively enhances code security while upholding its intended functionality. Our experiments show that despite the comprehensive application of a state-of-the-art approach, it falls short in addressing all vulnerabilities within the code, whereas PromSec effectively resolves each of them. Moreover, PromSec achieves more than an order-of-magnitude reduction in operational time, number of LLM queries, and security analysis costs. Furthermore, prompts optimized with PromSec for a certain LLM are transferable to other LLMs across programming languages and generalizable to unseen vulnerabilities in training. This study presents an essential step towards improving the trustworthiness of LLMs for secure and functioning code generation, significantly enhancing their large-scale integration in real-world software code development practices.},

abstract = {VirusTotal (VT) is a widely used scanning service for researchers and practitioners to label malicious entities and predict new security threats. Unfortunately, it is little known to the end-users how VT URL scanners decide on the maliciousness of entities and the attack types they are involved in (e.g., phishing or malware-hosting websites). In this paper, we conduct a systematic comparative study on VT URL scanners' behavior for different attack types of malicious URLs, in terms of 1) detection specialties, 2) stability, 3) correlations between scanners, and 4) lead/lag behaviors. Our findings highlight that the VT scanners commonly disagree with each other on their detection and attack type classification, leading to challenges in ascertaining the maliciousness of a URL and taking prompt mitigation actions according to different attack types. This motivates us to present a new highly accurate classifier that helps correctly identify the attack types of malicious URLs at the early stage. This in turn assists practitioners in performing better threat aggregation and choosing proper mitigation actions for different attack types},

	abstract = {We propose to identify compromised mobile devices from a network administrator’s point of view. Intuitively, inadvertent users (and thus their devices) who download apps through untrustworthy markets are often lured to install malicious apps through in-app advertisements or phishing. We thus hypothesize that devices sharing similar apps would have a similar likelihood of being compromised, resulting in an association between a compromised device and its apps. We propose to leverage such associations to identify unknown compromised devices using the guilt-by-association principle. Admittedly, such associations could be relatively weak as it is hard, if not impossible, for an app to automatically download and install other apps without explicit user initiation. We describe how we can magnify such associations by carefully choosing parameters when applying graph-based inferences. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on real datasets provided by a major mobile service provider. Specifically, we show that our approach achieves nearly 98\%
              AUC (area under the ROC curve)
              and further detects as many as 6 {\textasciitilde} 7 times of new compromised devices not covered by the ground truth by expanding the limited knowledge on known devices. We show that the newly detected devices indeed present undesirable behavior in terms of leaking private information and accessing risky IPs and domains. We further conduct in-depth analysis of the effectiveness of graph inferences to understand the unique structure of the associations between mobile devices and their apps, and its impact on graph inferences, based on which we propose how to choose key parameters.},

	abstract = {Malicious domains, including phishing websites, spam servers, and command and control servers, are the reason for many of the cyber attacks nowadays. Thus, detecting them in a timely manner is important to not only identify cyber attacks but also take preventive measures. There has been a plethora of techniques proposed to detect malicious domains by analyzing Domain Name System (DNS) traffic data. Traditionally, DNS acts as an Internet miscreant’s best friend, but we observe that the subtle traces in DNS logs left by such miscreants can be used against them to detect malicious domains. Our approach is to build a set of domain graphs by connecting “related” domains together and injecting known malicious and benign domains into these graphs so that we can make inferences about the other domains in the domain graphs. A key challenge in building these graphs is how to accurately identify related domains so that incorrect associations are minimized and the number of domains connected from the dataset is maximized. Based on our observations, we first train two classifiers and then devise a set of association rules that assist in linking domains together. We perform an in-depth empirical analysis of the graphs built using these association rules on passive DNS data and show that our techniques can detect many more malicious domains than the state-of-the-art.},

	abstract = {Malicious domains are one of the major resources required for adversaries to run attacks over the Internet. Due to the important role of the Domain Name System (DNS), extensive research has been conducted to identify malicious domains based on their unique behavior reflected in different phases of the life cycle of DNS queries and responses. Existing approaches differ significantly in terms of intuitions, data analysis methods as well as evaluation methodologies. This warrants a thorough systematization of the approaches and a careful review of the advantages and limitations of every group.
            In this article, we perform such an analysis. To achieve this goal, we present the necessary background knowledge on DNS and malicious activities leveraging DNS. We describe a general framework of malicious domain detection techniques using DNS data. Applying this framework, we categorize existing approaches using several orthogonal viewpoints, namely (1) sources of DNS data and their enrichment, (2) data analysis methods, and (3) evaluation strategies and metrics. In each aspect, we discuss the important challenges that the research community should address in order to fully realize the power of DNS data analysis to fight against attacks leveraging malicious domains.},

Our approach combines two independent aspects of video file generation corresponding to video coding and media data encapsulation.

At the first level, our method groups videos into metaclasses considering several abstractions that represent high-level structural properties of file metadata. This is followed by a more nuanced classification of classes that comprise each metaclass. The method is evaluated on more than 20K videos obtained by combining four public video datasets. Tests show that a balanced accuracy of 91\% is achieved in correctly identifying the class of a video among 119 video classes. This corresponds to an improvement of 6.5\% over the conventional approach based on video file encapsulation characteristics. Furthermore, we investigate a setting relevant to forensic file recovery operations where file metadata cannot be located or are missing but video data is partially available. By estimating a partial list of encoding parameters from coded video data, we demonstrate that an identification accuracy of 57\% can be achieved in camera-model identification in the absence of any other file metadata.},

	abstract = {Machine learning models, especially neural network (NN) classifiers, are widely used in many applications including natural language processing, computer vision and cybersecurity. They provide high accuracy under the assumption of attack-free scenarios. However, this assumption has been defied by the introduction of adversarial examples – carefully perturbed samples of input that are usually misclassified. Many researchers have tried to develop a defense against adversarial examples; however, we are still far from achieving that goal. In this paper, we design a Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) based adversarial training defense, dubbed GanDef, which utilizes a competition game to regulate the feature selection during the training. We analytically show that GanDef can train a classifier so it can defend against adversarial examples. Through extensive evaluation on different white-box adversarial examples, the classifier trained by GanDef shows the same level of test accuracy as those trained by state-of-the-art adversarial training defenses. More importantly, GanDef-Comb, a variant of GanDef, could utilize the discriminator to achieve a dynamic trade-off between correctly classifying original and adversarial examples. As a result, it achieves the highest overall test accuracy when the ratio of adversarial examples exceeds 41.7\%.},
